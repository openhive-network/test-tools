## Clean up policies

You can specify which files will be automatically removed when script finishes (when `World.__exit__` is called). Default behavior is:
- in automatic tests (running locally or in CI) -- unneeded files are removed (`constants.CleanUpPolicy.REMOVE_ONLY_UNNEEDED_FILES`)
- in manual tests -- no clean up is performed (`constants.CleanUpPolicy.DO_NOT_REMOVE_FILES`)

You can change this behavior for node and world. For example, if you want to access some file removed by default when test will finish, (let's say -- block log or shared memory file, from node which is running in automatic test), you can do it in following way:
```python
from test_tools import constants
node.set_clean_up_policy(constants.NodeCleanUpPolicy.DO_NOT_REMOVE_FILES)
```

Then you have guarantee, that no files generated by this node will be removed.
