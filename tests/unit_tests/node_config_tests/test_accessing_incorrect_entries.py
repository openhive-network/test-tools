# These tests checks if access to nonexistent keys in config are reported as errors.
#
# For example user should write:
#   config.witness = 'my-new-witness'
# but, might by accident write (note double 'n' in 'witness'):
#   config.witnness = 'my-new-witness'
#
# Then exception will be raised and error will be immediately noticed.
